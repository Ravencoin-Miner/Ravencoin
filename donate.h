/*
 * Minimum dev donation.
 * Minimum percentage of your hashing power that you want to donate to the
 * developer, can be 0 if you prefer not to.
 * You can set the donation percentage higher by using the --donate flag.
 *
 * Example of how it works for the default setting of 1:
 * You miner will mine into your usual pool for 99 minutes, then switch to the
 * developer's pool for 1 minute.
 *
 * If you plan on changing this setting to 0 please consider making a one-time
 * donation to the developers' wallets:
 *
 * tpruvot (ccminer)
 * BTC donation address: 1AJdfCpLWPNoAMDfHF1wD5y8VgKSSTHxPo
 *
 * brianmct (x16r optimizations)
 * BTC donation address: 1FHLroBZaB74QvQW5mBmAxCNVJNXa14mH5
 * RVN donation address: RWoSZX6j6WU6SVTVq5hKmdgPmmrYE9be5R
